<TITLE>CommandLine -- /LineMode</TITLE>
<NEXTID 3>
<H1>Command line syntax</H1>The syntax is:
<XMP>		www [options]  [docaddress [keywords]]

</XMP>With no arguments, the <A NAME=1 HREF=QuickGuide.html>www</A> shell command allows you to browse from
the system default page,  /usr/lib/WWW/default.html.<P>
Options should be specified before other arguments. Currently options
available are:-
<DL>
<DT>-n 
<DD>Non-interactive mode.  Outputs the formatted document to the standard
output, then exits.  Pages are delimited with form feed (FF) characters.
<DT>-pn
<DD> where n is a number, specifies the page length. Without a number,
makes the page length infinite. Default is 23. 
<DT>-v
<DD> Verbose mode: Gives a running commentary on the program's attempts
to read data in various ways.If present, the next argument is the
hypertext address of  the document at which you want to start browsing.
You may want to define an alias for www followed by name of your favourite
index.
<DT>-na
<DD> Hides anchor positions in the text. Useful, when printing out
the document.
<DT><A NAME=2>-a  format</A>
<DD> Specifies the printf -style format string to be used when
printing references. Must contain the two characters "%d"  where the
numbers should occur.  Be sure to escape or quote any special characters
you use.  For example under unix (where ^[ stands for ESCape):
</DL>

<XMP>				www -a \<%d\>
				www -a " (Type %d)"
				www -a "^[[1m[%d]^[[m"

</XMP>Any further command line arguments are taken as keywords. The first
argument must refer to an index in this case. The index is serached
for entries matching the keywords, and a list of matching entries
is displayed. ______________________________________________________
