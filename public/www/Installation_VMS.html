<NEXTID 3>
<H1>Installation under VMS</H1>To install under VMS, get the files WWW.EXE and SETUP.COM from sources
described below. To set up the commands, put the command
<XMP>			$ @[...]SETUP

</XMP>into your LOGIN.COM, or the system SYLOGIN.COM.  This command file
assumes you have left all the distributed files  in the same directory
as itself.
<H2>Home page</H2>Under VMS,  the home page may be defined using the logical name WWW_HOME.
You should define this to be the full address of the document which
you want to be displayed when www is invoked without parameters. For
example,
<XMP>        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM WWW_HOME "file://myvax/sys$library/default.html"

</XMP>Users may of course override the system logical name with their own.
If no logical name is defined, the VMS browser will default to picking
up the default page from our server,  document http://info.cern.ch./hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/default.html.
<H2><A NAME=1>Availability</A></H2>Versions are available for any of the following implementations of
TCP/IP which you may have installed on your system: Digital's UCX,
Wollongongs's WIN/TCP, or SRI's Multinet.  If you are on HEPnet, the
versions are currently (August 91) available in directories as follows:
<DL>
<DT>Wollongong WIN_TCP
<DD> none - mail me if interested.
<DT>Multinet
<DD> vxcrna::disk$oc1:[timbl.www.works]
<DT>Digital's UCX
<DD> online::disk$tim:[tim.www.works]
</DL>
If you are not on HEPnet, but can pick up and unwrap the tar file
from the <A NAME=2 HREF=Distribution.html>general distribution</A>,  then you will find executables in
the WWW/LineMode/Implementation/vms directory, as files www_ucx.exe
or www_multinet.exe. Pick one and rename it to www.exe
<H2>Note (CERN)</H2>If you are at CERN, you may want to pick up the default page and online
documentation from cernvax. This machine is known (for reasons of
history and name length limit) on decnet as PRIAM. You must therefore:
<XMP>			$ DEFINE/SYSTEM CERNVAX PRIAM::
